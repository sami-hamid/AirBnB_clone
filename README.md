Here I am Writting an HTML page that displays a header and a footer.

Layout:

Body:
no margin
no padding
Header:
color #FF0000 (red)
height: 70px
width: 100%
Footer:
color #00FF00 (green)
height: 60px
width: 100%
text Best School center vertically and horizontally
always at the bottom at the page.

Requirements:

You must use the header and footer tags
You are not allowed to import any files
You are not allowed to use the style tag in the head tag
Use inline styling for all your tags.

Final Result : 

I used header and footer tags.
I did not use any style tags in the head tag 
I used inline styling for all of my tags.

Let me explain the code:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration helps with browser compatibility.
The <header> tag is used for the header section.
 I have set the color to red (#FF0000) and the height and width to 70px and 100% respectively.
I have added a center area inside a <div> tag.
 I have set the height to calc(100vh - 130px) which means it will take up all the available height of the screen minus the height of the header and footer (130px).
The <footer> tag is used for the footer section.
 I have set the color to green (#00FF00), the height to 60px, and the width to 100%. I have also used display: flex;, align-items: center;, and justify-content: center; to vertically and horizontally center the text "Best School center".
